## UProjArkansas

This is a working Unreal Engine project created from the UE4SS dump.
It allows blueprint modder to directly use native game class either from cpp or blueprint.

This only contains the cpp class from which all blueprint classes inherit. You still need to use Fmodel to create dummies of the assets you want to use.

# How to to use

- Build Unreal Engine 5.4.4 modified for TOW2 (https://github.com/nathtest/UnrealEngine/tree/5.4.4-TOW2)
- Clone this repo
- Right click on the Arkansas.uproject file and generate "Visual Studio project files"
- Open the project in Visual studio -> compile it
- Open the editor
- Create mod and Enjoy

Warning : This project was created for fun. If you want help with Unreal Modding join the various discord servers that exist.

If you found some error in the project setup, you can create a pull request. I'm also open if people want to contribute and/or maintain the project.

# Mod Loader

To load your blueprint mod, you will need a mod loader and for that you can use Simple Mod Loader﻿ (created by KZekai).

# Credits

Credits to the UE4SS team for their incredible tool.
